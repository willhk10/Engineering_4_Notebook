# Hello_World
  ## [Code](https://github.com/willhk10/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/hello_world.py)
### This assignment required us to learn how to set up the Raspberry pi, which included logging into the Pi, using the Sudo Nano command to create the file, and running the file.

### Spicy_Version :)
This was almost the exact same as the previous assignment, however with a small addition. I had to look up [how to code factorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/factorial-in-python/) without using an imported math function. The code for this assignment is [HERE](https://github.com/willhk10/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/python_calculator_spicy.py).
