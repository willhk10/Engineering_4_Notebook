# Hello_World
This [assignment](https://github.com/willhk10/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/hello_world.py) required us to learn how to set up the Raspberry pi, which included logging into the Pi, using the Sudo Nano command to create the file, and running the file.

### Spicy_Version :)
This was almost the exact same as the previous assignment, however with a small addition. I had to look up [how to code factorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/factorial-in-python/) without using an imported math function. The code for this assignment is [HERE](https://github.com/willhk10/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Python/python_calculator_spicy.py).
